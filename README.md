# Hey there, I'm Vishal Tharu 👋

## About Me

I'm currently working on my Master's in Cybersecurity, chasing a big dream — to become a world-class Ethical Hacker who helps protect the world from the darker sides of technology. Sounds ambitious? Maybe. But I’m all in. I’ve always been curious about how systems work, how they break, and more importantly — how to fix and protect them. That curiosity turned into a passion, and now it’s the mission I wake up excited about every day.

## What I'm Learning & Working On

Cybersecurity is evolving fast, and I’m doing my best to stay ahead of the curve. Here are some of the areas I’m currently diving into:

- **Programming:** I'm building solid foundations in Python, C++, and JavaScript. These languages are my toolkit for crafting secure, efficient solutions.

- **Networking & System Administration:** Understanding how data flows and how systems tick is key to spotting weak points. I'm learning to think like both an architect and a hacker.

- **Linux & Operating Systems:** Whether it's deploying tools or poking at permissions, Linux is my go-to playground for security experiments.

- **Cloud Security:** With everything moving to the cloud, I’m learning how to keep data safe and secure on platforms like AWS and Azure.

- **AI & Machine Learning:** I'm fascinated by how AI can be used both to defend and attack. I'm exploring how to harness it for smarter security systems.

- **Problem Solving:** Whether it's debugging code or breaking down a breach scenario, I'm always sharpening my analytical thinking and looking for creative solutions.

## Looking for Internships 🚀

Right now, I’m on the lookout for internship opportunities where I can put my skills to the test and learn from experienced professionals. If you're working on something meaningful in cybersecurity (or know someone who is), I’d love to connect!

## A Little More About Me

When I’m not deep into code or network diagrams, you’ll probably find me:

♟️ Playing chess — big dream here: I want to be a Grandmaster someday. The strategy and depth of the game really speak to me.

🎤 Singing — it's something that lets me express myself in a completely different way. It's like hacking emotions instead of systems.

📚 Watching educational videos or reading — I genuinely enjoy learning. I prefer understanding over assuming, and I try to keep my mind open no matter what I’m exploring.

I can be a bit competitive (okay, maybe more than a bit 😅), but it's all in good spirit. Growth is the goal, always.
