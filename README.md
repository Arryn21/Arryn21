## 🚀 Snapshot of What I Do

**Offense meets defense:** I break things ethically to understand them, then build guardrails that hold up under pressure.

**Focus areas**
- Network & Web App Security (Nmap, Burp Suite, OWASP Top 10, DVWA / Juice Shop)
- Cloud Security on AWS (IAM, VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, CloudWatch, Lambda, API Gateway)
- SIEM & DFIR (Splunk, Windows Event Logs, Apache/Firewall logs, YARA basics)
- Secure Automation (Bash/Python tooling, logging, idempotent scripts)

**Primary stack**
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Bash
- **OS/Infra:** Linux, Windows Server, Docker (beginner), Git/GitHub Actions
- **Tools:** Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, Splunk, OWASP ZAP, Sysinternals
- **Cloud:** AWS (hands-on), Azure (learning)

## 🚀 My Cybersecurity Journey  

I didn’t start as a hacker. I started as someone simply *curious* — why does this work? Why does that break? Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion, and eventually a career path.  

Here’s how the journey unfolded:  

📌 **2019–2020: Early Spark**  
- First exposure to coding & networking.  
- Realized how fragile systems can be, and how exciting it is to *dig deeper*.  

📌 **2021: First Hands-On Experience**  
- Learned Linux basics and fell in love with the command line.  
- Started experimenting with small CTF challenges.  

📌 **2022: Industry Insight**  
- Joined **TCS as an SAP Consultant**, which gave me a professional perspective on enterprise systems.  
- Learned that **security isn’t just technical — it’s business-critical.**  

📌 **2024–Present: Master’s in Cybersecurity @ CSUDH**  
- Diving into cloud security, digital forensics, and ethical hacking.  
- Working on AWS projects, Splunk investigations, and secure system design.  
- Leading the **Cybersecurity Club** as President — building a community of learners and future defenders.  

📌 **Now → Future**  
- Preparing for **CCNA** after completing **CompTIA Security+**.  
- Actively looking for **Summer 2025 Cybersecurity Internships**.  
- Long-term vision: become an **Ethical Hacker** who protects organizations and educates others.

## 🎯 Beyond Tech  

- ♟️ **Chess:** aiming for Grandmaster someday. The parallels between chess strategy and cybersecurity tactics fascinate me.  
- 🎤 **Singing:** my creative outlet — hacking emotions instead of systems.  
- 🌱 **Learning addict:** I’d rather learn deeply than skim the surface.

## ✨ Fun Fact  

I believe curiosity is the most powerful hacking tool — it’s what got me started, and it’s what keeps me going.
